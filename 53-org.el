;; OK so I considered making an async `consult--read'.  But the problem is that
;; consult--read can be async-capable all it wants---it handles a callback like
;; a button it can press many times for output, but the callback needs itself
;; to be async, i.e. it's likely a process sentinel.  This works for ripgrep
;; because the external program ripgrep returns its output incrementally. Does
;; sqlite do that? I doubt it.  If sqlite MUST return all results at once,
;; then we cannot use org-roam's SQL database in this way.
;;
;; That is, we cannot filter via SQL. It can only send us the whole list (which
;; we could save in an Emacs variable in case the sql connection is laggy, but
;; whatever) and then we "fetch incrementally" from the variable.  More
;; specifically, we pass the variable to a filterer algorithm that outputs
;; incrementally.
;;
;; How to do that in an Emacs function?  We may have benefit of async.el, but
;; that isn't even necessary, it can use `while-no-input'.  And I guess that
;; might be built-in to `consult--read'.  But.. ugh, where do I---
;;
;; Scratch that.
;;
;; It was illuminating to think about, but I've been barking up the wrong tree.
;; Async completion is for when, AFTER having a giant table of data in hand,
;; and your minibuffer loaded and ready, you try to filter the results, and
;; find that it's laggy.  We don't have that problem: `completing-read' works
;; basically instant for ~1000 nodes (of course).  Our problem is in a
;; different domain: it takes time to open up the prompt in the first place.
;; That's so nonintuitive, because I didn't think SQLite was slow or that
;; anyone would bother to make a SQL DB if they were gonna use it
;; inefficiently, and yet `org-roam-node-list' takes ages just to cough up the
;; dataset.
;;
;; Here vulpea.el helps, it maintains a table in-memory that's optimized for
;; reading, although it's still not instant, so ultimately I'd like to to
;; memoize `vulpea-select-from' for a perfect UX.  But I can't seem to memoize
;; it.
