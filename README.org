* My Emacs config dir

Ever in development since 2015.  Requires Emacs 28.

You can find the more unique code in the =lisp= subfolder.  Aside from that, this follows Doom Emacs' structure:

- init.el -- which premade Doom modules to enable
- packages.el -- which additional packages to make available
- config.el -- loads every file in =lisp= subfolder
