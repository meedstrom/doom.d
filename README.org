* My Emacs config dir

In development since 2015.  Requires Emacs 28.

Most of the interesting code is in the files starting with a number, like =98-late.el= and =10-general.el=.

** Undooms

This is a Doom Emacs config, but I undo many Doom features (commented with the term "undoom").  Mind you, I still find Doom to save a lot of effort and well worth it.  Here are some things I undo:

#+begin_src elisp
;; undoom; I want readable backup names since I rename files and directories all
;; the time
(advice-remove #'make-backup-file-name-1 #'doom-make-hashed-backup-file-name-a)

;; undoom; I find customize a handy exploration tool
(put 'customize-themes 'disabled nil)
(put 'customize-group 'disabled nil)
(put 'customize-changed 'disabled nil)
(put 'customize-face 'disabled nil)
(put 'customize-variable 'disabled nil)

;; undoom; I actually use the modeline to show present directory
(remove-hook 'term-mode-hook #'hide-mode-line-mode)

(after! dired
  ;; undoom
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "q" #'kill-current-buffer))

(remove-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'dired-omit-mode) ;; undoom

(after! vertico
  ;; undoom
  (keymap-unset vertico-map "<backspace>" t))

;; undoom
(after! eshell
  (fmakunbound #'eshell/emacs) ;; give me access to emacs --help, heh
  (setopt eshell-input-filter #'eshell-input-filter-default)
  ;; I like normal buffer as opposed to terminal-like behavior 
  (setopt eshell-scroll-to-bottom-on-input nil)
  (setopt eshell-scroll-to-bottom-on-output nil)
  (keymap-set eshell-mode-map "C-l" #'recenter-top-bottom)
  ;; I prefer it pick a recent buffer (but tbh all other Emacs buffers are
  ;; similarly unhelpful on split, I should fix them too)
  (setopt +eshell-enable-new-shell-on-split nil))

;; undoom
(after! org
  ;; IDK why but I find this doom-docs-mode just gets in my way
  (fset 'doom-docs-org-mode #'ignore)
  (fset 'doom-docs--toggle-read-only-h #'ignore)
  ;; Having exactly two states makes for comfy toggling.  I liked that about vanilla Org.
  (setopt org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO" "DONE"))))

(after! ws-butler
  ;; Undoom. Was this a Vimism?  If this is nil while auto-save-visited-mode is
  ;; active, it's incredibly annoying.
  (setopt ws-butler-keep-whitespace-before-point t))
#+end_src
