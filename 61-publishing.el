;; I have a preexisting roam node named Changelog, and I write into it headings
;; for each month, following the format "Summary March 2022" etc.  That way,
;; this function would just plug in during org-publish to annotate a copy of
;; that one file to expand each heading with extra info.  Also creating the
;; heading if it doesn't exist yet (no need to create ID for those).
;;
;; Could discuss whether the summaries should just be titled "Changes March
;; 2022" to limit the scope, or if I'm to retitle the Changelog as a broader
;; "News", which fits better with broad-topic Summaries?
