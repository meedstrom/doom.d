;;; Commentary:

;; It's insane to put data-syncs on kill-emacs-hook.  Most of the time my emacs
;; goes down, it happens in a non-clean way -- why would I intentionally shut
;; off Emacs if everything is fine?  As a result, I'm missing some data
;; every time I start Emacs: I can't find org notes by org-id, recentf
;; suffers partial amnesia, and so on.  This has been annoying me for years.

;;; Code:

(defvar my-state-sync-hooks nil
  "Dynamic variable.
For some reason, lexical binding does not permit `my-state-sync'
to just let-bind a variable, so we have this.")

(defun my-state-sync ()
  "Write histories and caches to disk.
This runs many members of `kill-emacs-hook' so we don't have to
rely on that hook.  You may put this on a repeating timer."
