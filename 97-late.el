;; It sounds like Hyperbole is a sort of greybeard's Embark, and it packs a lot
;; more "batteries included".  A drawback is that Hyperbole uses different UI
;; metaphors than does Embark, metaphors that could feel natural to an
;; Ido/icomplete user, but not so much to Vertico/Ivy/Helm users.  That
;; shouldn't be too hard to get over though.  A feature that caught my interest:
;; lots of premade "buttons" that Embark lacks.
;;
;; I haven't even used Embark much, as I also struggle with its UI metaphor.
;; Could be worth trying Hyperbole.  While it has a hand-rolled UI, that also
;; means it's thought-through.  Every Embark popup is full of suggestions I
;; don't need.  I think to learn Hyperbole, I'd like all possible
;; targets/buttons colorized for me during a training period.  I'd also like the
;; Hyperbole prompts to come in a form utilizable by Vertico instead of that
;; ascetic oneline minibuffer -- not that the ascetic minibuffer is a bad idea,
;; but it feels less inviting as it breaks the paradigms I'm used to, and it's
;; less discoverable so I must put in more effort to discover what does what
;; (names like "hyrolo" certainly tell me nothing).
;;
;; To be clear where I'm coming from, I don't regard Embark and Hyperbole as
;; competing for popularity. (I'm the kind of user who uses Vertico for some
;; things and Helm for other things.)  It may well be that when one gets more
;; popular, so does the other.  Not zero-sum.  But I observe that people on the
;; subreddit seem much more ready to adopt Embark than they ever were ready to
;; adopt Hyperbole, so there could be a risk it goes the way of Icicles where
;; there's a handful of faithful users who don't publish anything about their
;; workflows and the rest of us have no idea if it contains any lessons to carry
;; over to the wider ecosystem and will not bother learning it in order to see,
;; because it's too strange.  I don't know the full scope of Hyperbole so stop
;; me if I'm wrong but would it be possible to reimplement Hyperbole to be only
;; a large collection of commands that only use completing-read as UI, together
;; with recommendations for where to bind them and how to configure Embark and
;; maybe some other packages?
