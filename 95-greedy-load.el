;;; Commentary:

;; It's starting to annoy me the delay in the first eshell, dired, and org-roam
;; buffers. Either design a :defer-incrementally list for each, or do some
;; general "load everything" during idle so that we have nothing left waiting to
;; be autoloaded...

;;; Code:

;; (use-package! dired
