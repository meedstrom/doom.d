;;; Stylistic tips

;; All the rainbow delimiters should be dark/subdued colors.
;;
;; Check if you like the org headings.
;;
;; Check the sharp quoted symbols in Lisp. Uncomment this:
;; #'some-function

;;; Notes

;; For most faces, Doom uses the terminal color names, which indicate the color
;; these things would be on a standard tty. The additional color names
;; primarily apply to prog-mode buffers, and are rarely used as reference.

;; Rainbow delimiters and Org headings each have three color levels in Doom
;; that then loop around.
;; - Rainbow goes 'dark-blue -> 'magenta -> 'green
;; - Org goes     'dark-blue -> 'magenta -> 'violet

;; Some errors get 'red instead of 'error.

;; ~org~ gets 'orange
;; =org= gets 'green
;; : org gets 'orange

;; Dired gets drwx in the order 'blue 'yellow 'error '[green or builtin]
;; Dired also uses 'orange, 'cyan, 'blue, 'violet...
