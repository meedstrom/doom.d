   ;; TIPS for designing a doom-theme:

   ;; 1. use hex strings, not color names, the latter wont work where your
   ;; theme or the base theme applies doom-blend/doom-darken/doom-lighten.
   ;;
   ;; 2. The 12 primary color names must be thoughtfully assigned first and all
   ;; be distinguishable.  Check the result in org-mode buffers.  The 20
   ;; semantic names are mostly applied in prog-modes.
   ;;
   ;; 3. Look the source for one of the flagship themes for information.
   ;;
   ;; 4. Each color is a list of 3 items. If you don't use the terminal, only
   ;; the first item is of interest, let the rest be grey.
   ;;
   ;; 5. Though it's tempting to reuse colors e.g. reuse the value of "red" for
   ;; the "error" color, this makes it harder to iterate your design.  Directly
   ;; assign all 12+20 colors, and only reuse colors that you somehow know
   ;; you'll never change or distsinguish, if any. I recommend forgetting about
   ;; the possibility.
   ;;
   ;; 6. rainbow-mode defaults end up pretty confusing imo, when names like
   ;; "red" which aren't you assigned to red at all get colored red. To only
   ;; colorize hex strings, (setq rainbow-x-colors nil).

;;; Notes

;; For most faces, Doom uses the terminal color names, which indicate the color
;; these things would be on a standard tty. The additional color names
;; primarily apply to prog-mode buffers, and are rarely used as reference.

;; Rainbow delimiters and Org headings each have three color levels in Doom
;; that then loop around.
;; - Rainbow goes 'dark-blue -> 'magenta -> 'green
;; - Org goes     'dark-blue -> 'magenta -> 'violet

;; Some errors get 'red instead of 'error.

;; ~org~ gets 'orange
;; =org= gets 'green
;; : org gets 'orange

;; Dired gets drwx in the order 'blue 'yellow 'error '[green or builtin]
;; Dired also uses 'orange, 'cyan, 'blue, 'violet...
