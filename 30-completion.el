;; TODO: Avoid matching on initialisms during plaintext search (consult-line,
;; consult-grep).
;;
;; How?
;;
;; With the Doom layer, it can be done manually by prepending or appending a =
;; sign to the search term
;;
;; But it should always be the case.
;;
;; completion-category-overrides has no category for simple text search.
;;
;; vertico-multiform-mode can know it's using consult-line, and it can control
;; completion-styles or orderless-matching-styles.





;; This worked in Emacs 28.  Why 29 causes warning?

;; Partial fix: only the first component should match on initialisms.  Then I
;; only need to append a = on the first search term, and the rest will anyway
;; not be analyzed for initialisms.
